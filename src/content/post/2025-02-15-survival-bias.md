# Survivorship Bias

Survivorship BiasÂ is a cognitive error where we focus only on the "successes" or visible outcomes while ignoring the "failures" or hidden data that didn't make it through a selection process. This bias leads to distorted conclusions because the full picture is not considered.

### **How Survivorship Bias Works**

1. **Selection Process**: Only certain outcomes (e.g., successes, glamorous lives) are visible, while others (e.g., failures, struggles) are hidden or ignored.
2. **Misleading Patterns**: We draw conclusions based on the visible data, assuming it represents the whole story.
3. **Overgeneralization**: We assume that the visible successes are the norm or easily achievable, ignoring the challenges or failures that others faced.

### **Survivorship Bias on Social Media**

Social media amplifies survivorship bias because platforms are designed to highlight the most engaging, glamorous, and successful content. Here's how it manifests:

1. **Curated Content**:
    - People tend to share their best moments (e.g., vacations, achievements, perfect selfies) rather than their struggles or mundane daily life.
    - This creates a skewed perception that everyone else is living a perfect, glamorous life.
2. **Algorithmic Bias**:
    - Social media algorithms prioritize content that gets the most engagement (likes, shares, comments), which is often the most polished and idealized.
    - This reinforces the visibility of "successful" or "glamorous" content while hiding less glamorous or relatable posts.
3. **Influencer Culture**:
    - Influencers and celebrities often portray an idealized version of their lives, showcasing luxury, beauty, and success.
    - Followers may compare their own lives to these curated images, leading to feelings of inadequacy or FOMO (fear of missing out).
4. **Lack of Context**:
    - Social media rarely shows the hard work, failures, or challenges behind success stories.
    - For example, a successful entrepreneur may showcase their achievements but not the years of struggle, rejection, or financial instability they faced.

### **How Survivorship Bias Influences Us**

1. **Unrealistic Comparisons**:
    - We compare our own lives to the highlight reels of others, leading to feelings of inadequacy, low self-esteem, or dissatisfaction.
2. **Misguided Aspirations**:
    - We may pursue goals (e.g., becoming an influencer, achieving a certain lifestyle) based on the visible successes of others, without understanding the challenges or risks involved.
3. **Overlooking Struggles**:
    - We underestimate the effort, time, and failures required to achieve success, assuming it comes easily to others.
4. **Distorted Reality**:
    - We perceive the glamorous, high-achieving side of life as the norm, ignoring the fact that most people experience struggles, failures, and ordinary moments.

### **How to Mitigate Survivorship Bias on Social Media**

1. **Be Aware of Curated Content**:
    - Remind yourself that social media is a highlight reel, not an accurate representation of someone's entire life.
2. **Seek Balance**:
    - Follow accounts that share authentic, relatable content, including struggles and failures, to get a more balanced perspective.
3. **Focus on Your Journey**:
    - Avoid comparing yourself to others and focus on your own goals, progress, and values.
4. **Educate Yourself**:
    - Learn about the behind-the-scenes efforts and challenges behind success stories to gain a more realistic understanding.
5. **Limit Social Media Use**:
    - Reduce time spent on social media to minimize exposure to idealized content and its psychological effects.

### **Example of Survivorship Bias on Social Media**

- **Fitness Influencers**: You see influencers with perfect bodies and assume they achieved this effortlessly. What you don't see are the hours of training, strict diets, or genetic advantages they may have.
- **Entrepreneurs**: You see successful entrepreneurs flaunting their wealth and assume it's easy to achieve. What you don't see are the years of failure, debt, or sleepless nights they endured.

By recognizing survivorship bias, we can develop a healthier relationship with social media and avoid falling into the trap of unrealistic comparisons.

Or alternatively, avoid social media all together!
