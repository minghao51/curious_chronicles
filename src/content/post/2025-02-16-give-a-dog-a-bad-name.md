## Give a dog a bad name and hang him

**“Give a dog a bad name and hang him"**. This English proverb means that if you spread false rumors about someone, it can ruin their reputation and lead to their downfall. A similar proverb is **he that has an ill name is half hanged**.


The observation is due to [negativity bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negativity_bias) – that people are apt to think poorly of others on weak evidence. This is then reinforced by [confirmation bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias) as people give more weight to evidence that supports a preconception than evidence which contradicts it.

> A distorted lens lays flat on the ground represents negativity bias, tainting perception. the lens itself  has a filter that casts  a grey tint.  The same lens selectively focuses, illustrating its bias for confirmation, focusing on an imperfection - a hole on an otherwise uniformly textured surface.

## Historical Figures:

Consider how certain historical figures have been demonized and their reputations tarnished, sometimes for centuries after their death. Often, these negative portrayals are based on biased accounts or outright fabrications. The 'bad name' becomes their legacy, obscuring their actual contributions and complexities. One particularly striking example of this phenomenon is Nero (Ancient Rome):

Nero is perhaps one of the most infamous Roman emperors. He's often remembered as a cruel tyrant who persecuted Christians and may have even been responsible for the Great Fire of Rome. While some of the more sensational stories about Nero might be exaggerations or outright fabrications, the negative image of him has endured for centuries. This 'bad name' has become synonymous with tyranny and excess, overshadowing any potential positive aspects of his reign, such as his patronage of the arts.

## Chinese idioms

There is a similar, albeit slightly different Chinese proverb - 欲加之罪，何患无辞.

## Call to action

Hence, before believe and sharing a rumour, ask yourself

1. Is this information reliable?
2. What's the potential impact of spreading it? 

This is especially important in our digital era, where rumors and false information can spread like wildfire on social media. A single click can amplify a 'bad name' to millions, with devastating consequences. It's crucial to be discerning consumers of information and to resist the urge to share unverified claims. In the end, the proverb 'Give a dog a bad name and hang him' serves as a timeless reminder of the power of words and the importance of critical thinking.”
